I crunch numbers and swear swears, and then I take a break from numbers to have a drink and read. I write Many Codes, and backpack many places, but I only ride one bicycle at a time. \n\nI'm currently figuring out this site; it's developing quickly, so check back periodically. While I'm working on that, you might want to read more [about me](/about), or checkout my [github](http://www.github.com/Gastove). I've also got not one but _two_ blogs! The [more professional one](http://blog.gastove.com) is about code and data science; the [less professional one](http://food.gastove.com) is about food and eating. They are both very pleased to meet you."),
