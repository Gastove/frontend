* Getting this bid'ness launched.

+ Well this is hilarious. [0/3]
  + [ ] Implement express.
    This will probably be a pain in the butt?
  + [ ] Figure out how the ass to deploy
    This one is much trickier.
  + [ ] Manage git via javascript?
    Looks like ~gulp-git~. Neat?

* The Deploy
K, how'm I thinking I'ma do this one?

1. Do the build.
   Does this happen on Master or no? Probably yes -- all the build crap can be dev dependencies, which will be present locally (regardless of Heroku) Then, Heroku does no build.
   - Switch to master
   - build into some deploy dir
   - git add
   - git commit
   - git push origin master
   - git push heroku master
   - Switch back to dev/staging
2. Commit the build to master
3. Deploy master to Heroku
4. It is awesome.
